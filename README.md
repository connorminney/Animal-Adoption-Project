# Animal-Adoption-Project
A repository for a machine learning model used to predict animal adoptions from the Austin Animal Center.

Included is a the data (AAC Animal Intakes), a python script that was used for model prototyping, and an R script that will be the final product.

To run the scripts, make sure you install the appropriate libraries and update the file paths. Everything else should be automated.
